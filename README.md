# Extracting-and-Visualizing-Stock-Data-Tesla-GameStop

This project focuses on extracting historical stock data for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) using the yfinance library, and scraping revenue data from web sources using BeautifulSoup. The collected data is then cleaned, processed, and visualized through interactive graphs created with plotly.

The visualizations help illustrate the relationship between stock performance and revenue trends for both companies, offering insights up to mid-2021. This notebook serves as a practical example of combining financial APIs, web scraping, and data visualization in Python.
