# Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data: Tesla & GameStop

This project is part of the final assignment for the "Python Project for Data Science" course offered by IBM on Coursera, which is included in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate program.

In this project, we extract historical stock data for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) using the yfinance library, and scrape corresponding revenue data from HTML tables using BeautifulSoup. The data is then cleaned and visualized using interactive plots with plotly, allowing us to explore the relationship between stock price movements and company revenue over time.

The goal of the assignment is to apply real-world data science techniques — including API usage, web scraping, data wrangling, and data visualization — in a cohesive Python notebook. The resulting insights reflect data up to mid-2021.
